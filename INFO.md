## How to add them
> Dopamine's **.theme** files are found in ```C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Dopamine\Themes\``` alognside a couple others. You can then copy the source code from one file to a new one and change its HTML or RGB values to your liking. Note that you have to restart dopamine before your color scheme will show up in appearance settings [^2]

> Finally, i am aware that is a tutorial within the app's files that shows you how to modify a theme directly, this is just a repo for files you can manually add alongside the other themes

Also keep in mind that I originally made this repository to store and share the many themes I've created for Dopamine 3, a music player thats actually quite customizable, and found that you could mess the **.theme** files, and as a web developer i thought it would be fun to make a myriad of custom themes.
