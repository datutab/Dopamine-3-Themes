### I originally made this repository to store and share the many themes I've created for Dopamine 3, a music player thats actually quite customizable, and found that you could mess the **.theme** files, and as a web developer i thought it would be fun to make a myriad of custom themes. [^1]

## How to add them
> Dopamine's **.theme** files are found in ```C:\Users\Datur\AppData\Roaming\Dopamine\Themes\``` alognside a couple others. You can then copy the source code from one file to a new one and change its HTML or RGB values to your liking. ~note that you have to restart dopamine before your color scheme will c=show up in appearance settings~
